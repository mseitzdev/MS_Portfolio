            My name is Mitchell Seitz, and I'm a third-year Comp Sci student at Thompson Rivers University.
            I've been studying online for my University education, and so I guess I consider myself 
            a self-taught developer as well. I've also run a small business as a handyman, and am a co-founder of
            a nonprofit dedicated to supporting youth in and from the foster care system called Project Outsiders. 
            My journey here has been somewhat unique, so I might as well tell you a bit about myself so you can understand 
            how I got here. 
            <br><br> 
            During High School, I ended up homeless and then in the 
            foster care system. In order to stay in school, I switched to a 
            school that only had space available in a trades co-op program.
            I graduated at 17, and at 18 I registered a business and began working 
            as a handyman. I also worked service jobs, landscaping, 
            demolition, construction, property maintenance, and other jobs. 
            <br><br>
            After graduating, I found myself curious, and started self-teaching things I missed in school. 
            Initially, I brought home university textbooks left by graduates in some apartment buildings I worked in.
            I was interested in a variety of things, like math, neuroscience, 
            and human biology. Later, my curiosity took a more technical focus, and 
            I spent free time using brilliant.org on the bus, using the wolfram problem generators, and spent my breaks at 
            work reading some of the textbooks I found and learning math from them.
            I also learned some python, started messing around with an arduino and raspberry pi, and dabbled in languages. 
            <br><br>
            Eventually, I felt like I had caught up on learning, and when I 
            was 19 I decided I wanted to pursue university education. I enrolled with Athabasca 
            University, which has open admission for online courses that transfer well to pretty much any 
            university in Canada. The flexibility was nice, but truthfully I took this route to avoid doing pre-requisites.
            After a few courses, I realized that I was most interested in computer science and decided 
            to pursue this path. I completed twelve courses with a 3.71/4.00 GPA,
            including Data Structures & Algorithms, Calculus, Stats, 
            Programming in Java, C++, and a few others.

            Unfortunately, studying online is kind of boring. Fortunately, I had friends to keep me compnay during this time, 
            including some amazing people who I met in the foster care system as a teenager. When we reconnected,
            it turned out a few of us had the same idea. We imagined a organization, created and led by youth with lived 
            experience in the foster care system, to advocate for and provide support for young people in and from care.

        <p class="paragraphStandard">

            <br>
            One of those people was Chanice McAnuff, and she took on the commitment and responsibility 
            of leading the organization, and I was happy to work with her to find ways to make our 
            goals work as a co-founder. 
            During 2020, we started meeting on zoom and over the phone to 
            form the basis for what the organization would look like. At some point, we started to meet in person, 
            setting up AV equipment and getting ready to record media to bring attention to our cause. It started 
            with a podcast, but grew to include events, media training, outreach, social media, and more.  
            <br><br> 
            Project Outsiders grew quickly, and after lots of hard work, networking, funding proposals, 
            and planning, we were able to begin filming "The Youth In Care Project" documentary. Between 2021 and 
            2023, production proceeded, and finally we were able to premire at the 
            <a href="https://www.yorkcas.org/news/the-youth-in-care-project-to-premiere-at-tiff/"> 
                Toronto International Film Festival in November 2023. 
            </a> 
            As of right now, Project Outsiders is taking a bit of a break in order to allow team members to attend
            other important things,  but I hope to be able to share a way to view the documentary with you soon.
            <br><br>
            Project Outsiders was and is very important to me, and I met many of my best friends during the course 
            of our activism. It was amazing to be able to work with people who had similar backgrounds to my own 
            and were still able to work hard and succeed.
            I learned a lot from working with and getting close to the team, and I am a better and 
            more well-rounded person because of it. While my academic journey started as a 
            teenager trying to self-teach computer science and math, Project Outsiders is where I would 
            say I started really developing emotional intelligence and maturity. I will be forever grateful that I 
            was able to spend my early twenties with such good people working towards a greater cause.

        <p class="paragraphStandard">

            Of course, juggling my small business, Project Outsiders, school, other jobs, and family responsibilities 
            was a lot, and at some point I had to narrow my activities and focus more on school. 
            I started this by transferring to 
            Thompson Rivers University, and started classes in 2023. I chose TRU because the program structure allows 
            me to take classes online via Open Learning, in person at TRU, or any accredited university in Canada.
            Truthfully, a big reason why I chose TRU because my younger years were quite chaotic, and I like the security 
            of being able to continue getting educated regardless of my living situation, transportation 
            budget, physical location, or other factors that may get in the way of traditional school. 
            Plus, I can always take classes in person anywhere I want, which is an amazing plus.
            <br><br>
            As of Summer 2024, I stepped back a lot from activism and working as a handyman, 
            and have been focusing on portfolio building, personal projects, preparing to do some freelance development, 
            and getting ready to study full-time until I am done my degree. I'll be adding more to this 
            portfolio shortly, so stay tuned!
