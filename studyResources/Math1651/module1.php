      <br><h2>Introduction</h2><br>

      <p class="paragraphStandard">

        The first module of this course covers vectors, and 
        consists of four topics. Because this is the first 
        module of a math course, and I have not taken math 
        in a long time, I found it helpful to do extra 
        practice during this module to get used to doing 
        math again. I suggest anyone who is struggling or 
        has not done math in a while do the same, as the 
        course textbook includes gret examples but repetition
        is the best way to develop skill with solving 
        math problems. I left the practice generators at 
        the end of this page, but feel free to check them 
        out early.

      </p>

      <br><h2> Topic 1: Geometry and Algebra of Vectors</h2><br>

      <p class="paragraphStandard">

        The first topic covers a broad range of fairly 
        simple topics. In case you struggle with what is
        found in our textbook, these resources may help. I 
        also recomend using the practice generators and 
        techniques at the end of this page to practice 
        and get back in the flow of doing math.

      <br><h2> Topic 2: Length and Angle </h2><br>

      <p class="paragraphStandard">

        The second topic builds on the first and gives us a solid 
        foundation for later learning. Be very careful to remember 
        this stufff, it comes in handy later. Also, take this an an 
        opportunity to try out Wolfram Alpha and Symbolab to see 
        what they can do. They can give you proofs for the inequalities
        and theorems, calculate vector projections, angles, lengths, 
        and more.

      <br><h2> Practice Question Generators </h2><br>

      <p class="paragraphStandard">

        For this Module, I found it useful to do extra practice 
        to help memorize key concepts and get my algebra back up 
        to speed. Wolfram and Symbolab both do vector 
        addition/subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot
        product, but wolfram has cross products and symbolab 
        has angles and projections. You can also input problems 
        into either site to generate solutions for other practice 
        questions:

        To create practice problems in topics not included in the 
        practice problem generators, you can use the rand button 
        on your calculator, your computer, or your imagination to 
        get random numbers, use these to fill out points/lines/etc, and 
        make your own practice problems. Calculate the distance between 
        points/planes/lines etc made using these numbers, and then 
        ask Wolfram Alpha or Symbolab to solve the problem for you. 
        Check your answers and if you need to then you can get a subscription 
        to one of these services to see how to solve them.
