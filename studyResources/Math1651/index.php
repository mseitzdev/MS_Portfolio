        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;"> Introduction </h2>
        <br>
        
        <p class="paragraphStandard">

            Because I spent most of high school on a construction site, I 
            ended up needing to self-teach most of the math I know. I 
            recognize a lot of the course material as things I learned 
            from brilliant.org before I ever started in University, and 
            I am lucky that I by chance happened to build a solid math 
            foundation via self-teaching before starting University.
            <br><br>
            For those of you taking MATH 1651 as mature students, you may be 
            in a similar boat, and after having already completed Calculus 
            and Statistics during my first year, the best advice I can 
            give for learning math as adults is that it is important to 
            learn rules for exponents, fractions, square roots, 
            trig, geometry, polynomials, and anything else that you can 
            find that you may have missed or forgotten from high school. 
            <br><br> 
            For those of you fresh into TRU after high school or a relevant
            college program, congrats! You already probably have what you
            should know for beginning this course. Feel free to use these 
            resources to supplement your existing knowledge. 
            <br><br>
            I have compiled here a list of important resources that I have 
            studied during this course as a student, or from my earlier curiosity,
            and hope that they can benefit you as much as they have benefitted 
            me. I have sorted them into general resources and then for each 
            module of our program.

        </p>

        <h2> Preparatory Resources </h2>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraphStandard">

            If you have some money to spend, you will likely benefit from
            Brilliant.org, which is where I formed my foundation 
            of math knowledge. A subscription costs between 10-30$ USD/CAD 
            monthly at the time I am writing this. I no longer use Brilliant as a 
            service, but it taught me the basics of many 
            things that come up in this course before I even started. 
            <br><br>
            For mature students, I strongly 
            recommend giving Brilliant a solid go before even enrolling in this 
            course. You won't regret it, and it will teach you a lot of what is 
            in this course already if you go through the logic, symbols, algebra, 
            and other course-related sections.

        <p class="paragraphStandard">

            Other than, or in addition to brilliant, make sure to brush up on the 
            following basic math rules, as they can prevent you from making small 
            mistakes and ensure that you can present your answers in the proper 
            format:

            If you're like me starting and haven't done math in a while, you may feel more comfortable
            after practicing general algebra before starting this course. I feel no shame 
            in ocassionally practicing algebra after not doing math in a long time, as it 
            fires up my math brain and gets me ready for more complex topics. Think of it 
            as a warmup - You wouldn't stop working out for a year and head to the gym to 
            lift the biggest weight of your life, so don't feel bad about practicing y=mx+b
            before heading into university level math. 
            <br><br>
            Here are some khan academy lessons that make a good warmup:

            If you're really not familiar with math, here is a link to all algebra on 
            Khan Academy, which is likely more than what you need, but 
            I included it here because I think it can provide the math you 
            need to know to start this course. It's probably overkill to do all 
            of this for most people, but if someone had zero math knowledge, 
            I'd think that this could get them ready for not just this course,
            but any first year math course. For most people, just pick out 
            things you see in this course that you struggle with, and it should 
            be a useful adjunct to your learning.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;"> General Advice </h2>
        <br>
        
        <p class="paragraphStandard">

           As a student in this course, my advice for others studying are: 
           <br> 

           <br>
           <b> 1 - Practice: </b> Make sure to do lots of extra practice on anything 
           you find yourself not doing well consistently. Use the study 
           resources in this guide to find places to practice concepts from this course, 
           and search the internet for more if you find yourself struggling with something
           not covered here or in the course material. The practice questions in this course 
           do a good job of teaching concepts, but repetition is how you can get the best 
           results when problem solving. 

           <br><br>
           <b> 2 - Graphing & Computational programs: </b> Don't hesitate to make use 
           of math-specific programs to suit your needs. Some examples of ones I like 
           to use are: 

           <br><br>
           <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha (link)</a> is an 
           amazing resource for graphing out examples, calculating solutions, and asking 
           questions. The free features are good enough for me most of the time, and I use 
           it to get extra practice out of the textbook by having it find answers to 
           questions where no answer is given, as well as 
           <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/problem-generator/"> 
           generating practice problems (link)
           </a> 
           and graphing out things I wonder about. Check it out, play with it, and 
           if you get something wrong, it should be able to solve it for you and show 
           you how it did it.
           <br><br>

           <a href="https://www.symbolab.com/">Symbolab (link)</a> is similar to 
           wolfram alpha, and contains some generators for practice problem types 
           that wolfram alpha does not have, like vector angle and projections. Check 
           this one out too, because between sybmolab and wolfram alpha you should have
           many bases covered. 
           <br><br>

           <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos (link)</a> is a graphing 
           calculator, right in your browser. It isn't as useful in this course as it 
           would be in calculus, but it's good to know. 

           <br><br>
           <b> 3 - Glossary: </b> Make sure to follow the advice in the study guide and 
           take notes, on paper or on the computer, recording all relevant keywords
           and concepts in this course in the way that they make 
           the most sense to you. This is important to have because the modules are mostly 
           disconnected and it is easy to forget things you aren't regularly using. Make 
           your glossary/notes and go over them regularly. I like to color-code my notes, 
           as this helps me read and understand easier. Here's an example: 
           <br><br>
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="vectorNote.png" alt="A page of my notes on vectors." style="max-width: 70%;">
        </div>
           
        <p class="paragraphStandard">

           <br><br>
           <b> 4 - Talk to others!: </b> Don't be afraid to ask for help from friends, 
           fellow students, faculty, or anyone else who may know useful things. I don't
           have this luxury because I am studying online, but to those that do, do 
           not squander it! There's a reason we can use language, and it can make things much 
           easier to understand. 

        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;"> Navigation </h2>
        <br>

        <p style="font-size: 19px; ">

            Finally, I have separated resources by module. The three ways to navigate are:
            <br><br>
            1: Via the side menu, under "Study Resources -> Math 1651"<br><br>
            2: Via the module menu at the top of the study guide pages<br><br>
            3: Via the links at the bottom of the page:<br><br>

        </p>

        <?php 
            //including the module links at the bottom of the page
            include '1651ModuleLinks.php'; 
        ?>

    </div>

</main>

<?php 
//including footer 
include '../../res/footer.php';
